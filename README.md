# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MattSimpson26

I am a self taught developer from the UK. I started learning web development in 2021 and after a long break whilst travelling Australia, I picked it up again in late 2023. My goal is to find my first Web Development job by the end of 2024. 

I am currently learning JavaScript on the backend, namely Node and Express and will then look to implement Databases after this. I am also undertaking projects that help me practise and improve my CSS and frontend JavaScript skills and knowledge. This includes frameworks such as Bootstrap for CSS and React for JavaScript, although I will be learning different frameworks soon.
